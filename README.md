This is just a hypothetical code, and there are many challenges that would need to be overcome in order to implement it. However, it provides a basic framework for how a free quantum internet could be created.

Additional notes:

The QuantumComputerNetwork class is a hypothetical class that would represent a network of quantum computers connected using quantum entanglement.
The send_data() and receive_data() methods are hypothetical methods that would allow quantum computers to send and receive data using quantum entanglement.
The h() and measure() gates are quantum gates that are used to create and measure quantum entanglement.
Overall, the idea of a free quantum internet is very exciting and has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact with the world around us.
